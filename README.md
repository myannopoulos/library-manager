# Library Manager

This is my personal format to manage my books library. I plan to expand it / add new features in the future so if you have any ideas let me know!

## Requirements

A database, somewhere.  
An Apache Webserver to connect your database with the frontend.  
A Google Books API key.

## Usage

Simply initialize the credential files with your database info and API key and you're set!  
You can add any book you currently own or want to own by simply typing in its ISBN.  
You can also update a books status (whether it's a Wishlist book, Owned or already Read) and lastly, you can delete a book from your library.
